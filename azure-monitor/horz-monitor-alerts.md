## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, see [Choose the right monitoring alert type](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types).

There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, see [Sample log alert queries](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log-alert-query-samples).

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, see [Common alert schema for ](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).
